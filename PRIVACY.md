Last updated on February 23rd, 2022

We're transparent about changes to our policies over time. You can view the history of this policy and others on our [GitHub](https://github.com/drillmetrix/policies).

## Contact details

If you would like any further clarification or require this policy in an alternative format, please contact us using the email address [hello@drillmetrix.com](mailto:hello@drillmetrix.com).

## Applicability

Drillmetrix Ltd. (henceforth referred to as "drillmetrix", "we", "us" or "our") is a registered company (number 11538388) in the United Kingdom. This policy describes the way we collect, process and protect the personally identifiable information (also "personal data", "personal information") of our users (henceforth referred to as "you" or "your") and applies to all services we provide at the domain drillmetrix.com (henceforth referred to as "website").

## How we store your personal information

All personal information is stored exclusively within the United Kingdom.

## Types of personal data collected

We collect the following types of personal data from you directly:

* **Personal identifiers, contacts and characteristics**, specifically: your name, e-mail address, the organisation you are a member of or eligible to be a member of (and are likely an employee of) and your user role (which may be related to your professional role).

* **Online identifiers**, specifically: your public Internet Protocol (IP address) address; information about your browser and system configuration; session and persistent cookies for identification.

* **Information relating to your activities**, specifically any interactions you have with our website and the time that you perform them.

## How we collect your data and why

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:

* **Your consent** - You are indicating your consent when you first request a one time passcode to sign in to our website (i.e. clicking 'Request Passcode' on our login page). You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the email address [hello@drillmetrix.com](mailto:hello@drillmetrix.com), and we will erase all personal data that we hold about you.

* **We have a legitimate interest** - Third party services from Cloudflare operating on this domain collect information about you without your consent, including your public IP address, system configuration and the URL you are requesting. This data is used to protect our website from malicious attacks and further secure the personal data of all our users.

### Security

We rely on our **legitimate interest** of security for third-party services provided by Cloudflare to collect information without your consent (i.e. prior to clicking the 'Request Passcode' button on our login page). This includes your public IP address, system configuration and the URL you are attempting to visit. This is to help us identify potentially malicious traffic and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This information alone is unlikely to identify you personally but could be used to provide some information about you, for example your geolocation. This data is collected and processed by Cloudflare according to their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/) in which you constitute an End User, and is only shared with drillmetrix in an aggregated and anonymised form.

### Identity verification

Once you indicate **consent** by requesting a one time passcode, we will set strictly necessary, persistent identifying cookies in your browser. We will also store your IP address and information about your browser. This will be used to identify your browser on subsequent visits to drillmetrix.com. If you do not successfully complete the login process, we will delete this data after 30 days. However, if you make several failed requests we will store it indefinitely on a blacklist to protect our services from potential attacks.

If we have identified your traffic as suspicious, we will additionally present you with a reCAPTCHA challenge provided by Google to prove that you are human, for which a separate [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.

### Account and preferences

When you successfully log in to drillmetrix for the first time, you will be asked for your name. Your name and email address will then be made public to members of your organisation to identify you and the actions you perform. Other organisation members may additionally assign you a user role, which may allow identifying your job role and profession.

We will additionally store any preferences you indicate during the course of your use of our website. For example, you may indicate that you prefer a certain language or dates to be displayed in a particular time zone.

All information related to your account will be stored until your account is deleted by your organisation's administrator, often on termination of your employment. If you wish for us to delete your account prior to this please contact us directly using the email address [hello@drillmetrix.com](mailto:hello@drillmetrix.com), being sure to include your name, organisation and registered email address.

### Activity logging

Whilst you are logged in, any interactions you have will be recorded alongside the time they were performed. We use this data to analyse the duration of your sessions and the pages you visit to improve our service. Some activities are made public to members of your organisation, for example editing a program file, so that we can provide traceability to your organisation's members. This data will be retained until your organisation's account is deleted, though if you request for your account to be deleted prior to this any public activity data will be disassociated from your personal information.

### Contacting us

If you contact us, for example by emailing the address [hello@drillmetrix.com](mailto:hello@drillmetrix.com), we will keep records of your correspondence for a period not exceeding six months. You can always ask us to erase such records when we have serviced your request as part of your email.

### Contacting you

As an ordinary user, we typically do not contact you regularly. However, it may be necessary to contact you by email on an ad-hoc basis for issues related to your account or in response to queries you make. We will also contact you to notify you of any changes to this policy.

If you are an administrator for your organisation, you will automatically receive occasional marketing communications from us by email to notify you of new features being added to the platform. You can unsubscribe from these updates at any time by simply responding to the email and asking to be removed from the mailing list. You will also receive any emails relating to the security of your organisation which cannot be unsubscribed from, for example if we detect suspicious activity and require you to take action. You may also be contacted on an ad-hoc basis to discuss other matters, such as billing.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small bits of texts stored by your browser. They are used by drillmetrix to identify your browser and information pertaining to your session, and are **strictly necessary** to the functioning of our website. We do not store any personal identifiers (like your name or email address) within cookies, and only drillmetrix can use these cookies to identify you.

For further information, including how to erase and manage cookies, please visit [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/)

## Your data protection rights

Under data protection law, you have rights including:

* **Your right of access** - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.

* **Your right to rectification** - You have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.

* **Your right to erasure** - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances.

* **Your right to restriction of processing** - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.

* **Your right to object to processing** - You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.

* **Your right to data portability** - You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.

You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.

Please contact us using the email address [hello@drillmetrix.com](mailto:hello@drillmetrix.com) if you wish to exercise any of your rights.

## How to complain
